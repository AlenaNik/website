## 10 years of pushing the boundaries

### Work in progress

This year we want to shift our attention to the decade of progress in the world of frontend development. Back in 2013, we went through a period of thinking and rethinking best practices and frontend development took off as one of the most common disciplines in tech. Frameworks like React and Vue now enter into their second decade of existence.

So in 2023, let's celebrate the past 10 years, reflecting on the evolution of our tools and patterns, with the good and the bad that comes with this rapid evolution.
