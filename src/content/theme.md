## Let's Reconnect in 2022

We usually pick a few topics we want to spotlight and a general theme for each JSHeroes event. But after two hard years of limited community interaction and in-person events, we feel the best thing to do is to <strong>bring the community back together</strong>.

So let's focus on <strong>rebuilding</strong> the amazing community we had before. We are starting small, but with a clear objective of bringing <strong>the same warm and engaging vibes</strong> that JSHeroes events always had.

Being part of an engaging community feels good! This year, communities are back together, to share stories and catch up. Connection via peer groups can help us have a healthier mindset, improved self worth, and greater enjoyment of life.
