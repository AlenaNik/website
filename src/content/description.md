## An Open-Source Community Event

We believe that the **community** and the **open-source** models are well suited for our core values: learning, teaching and knowledge sharing. Our mission is to inspire other communities with the concept of open-source events.

We're publishing all data about this conference, in [full transparency](https://medium.com/cluj-javascripters/jsheroes-2019-transparency-report-3731539de52f). We are also available at any time for inquires and we're really looking forward to sharing our knowledge about organizing international events. This way, whenever a community wants to start something similar, they can build on our knowledge.
